This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I love photography and being born and raised from a mountainous region. I always love to take pictures of mountain and now after moving to California, i have been exploring more into my photography skills where trying to take pictures of the street life as well. 
Being a full-stack web developer, i thought i will take this oppurtunity and create a responsive web-application showcasing my skills both as passionate photographer and web developer, i have made a photo album where you can enjoy glimpse of my pictures.
